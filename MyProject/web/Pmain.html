<p style="color:firebrick; padding:20px; font:40px Arial;"><u>Why Billionaires consider Charity?</u>
<p style="color:firebrick; padding:20px; font:22px Arial;">

Andrew Carnegie once said “The man who dies rich dies disgraced” if you think that is the reason why billionaires turn to charity, well you are only scratching the surface of this enigmatic topic. When it comes to billionaires some of them have given away whopping amounts of wealth like Azim Premji who recently gave away half of his stake in Wipro amounting to billions of dollars, Bill gates is not only at zenith when it comes to net worth, he is one of the most generous donors, he and his wife have given over $28 billion via their charitable foundation. 
<br><br>
Philanthropy among billionaires has become much more professional than the sweet old-fashioned giving, one of the massive changes is that there is far more interest in accountability. One of the reasons for doing charity by the ultra-rich class is their belief that charity does a better job to invest their money effectively than the government, credibility and ambition are also deterministic in why billionaires donate. Bringing transforming impact in various spheres of life hold a particular appeal to ambitious donors. Billionaires aren’t just always trying to avoid taxes, they do care about the fellow humans. 
<br><br>
To the likes of Warren Buffet, the environment does matters. A lavish array of Billionaires today is keen to take up the projects for environmental sustainability. The internet has become a core part of everyday life for everyone around the globe and this is one of the reasons why charity is going digital, digital portals like Sublime causes have emerged which connect contributors to causes and help in raising money through crowd funding. There is no dearth of causes which need to be addressed and we should be thankful to the handful of people who are capable enough to contribute to these causes. Pledging an amount for good can make a huge difference for the vulnerable. Come forward to charity with Sublime Causes and get an easy way to reach the needy.
